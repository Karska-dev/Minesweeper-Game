This is a [Minesweeper game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) as you may remember it from Microsoft Windows standard games.
Design a bit different. Mint pastel color scheme.
Build with HTML, CSS and JS.
I was inspired by tutorial of Ania Kub√≥w from [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxdGAKRndz8)

Some rules: 
There are 20bombs on the field. 
Each cell can be checked, unchecked and flagged. 
Checked cell will show you the number of bomb around it.
You lose if you check a cell with a bomb.
You win if you flag all the hidden bombs.
